# GIMP-batch_monochromize_png
GIMP script to use the positional dither to make images black-and-white. I thought it looked nicer than what I was able to get with Imagemagick's dithering options.

GIMP scripts are kind of annoying to use, so you're mostly on your own for this one.

How I think you use this:  
1. Copy the .scm script to the gimps script folder. On Windows, the path looks like "C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\share\gimp\2.0\scripts".  
2. Put the .png images you want to convert in a folder with the .bat, and click the .bat.

(I might as well add a .jpg to .png batch script, too.)
